# What is Suiftly?

Adds fast Walrus loading to your Web2/Web3 sites with:

  (1) Simple CDN links (e.g. `https://cdn.suiftly.io/blob/myblob`)
  (2) Safer open-source NPM JS and react package (recommended)
  (3) suiftly.site optimized portal (future)

The NPM packages will provide:
  - Automatic CDN to Walrus failover
  - React components helper (e.g. `<ImageBlob src="..." blob_id="..." />`)
  - "Trust your CDN... but verify" feature. Makes your client validate the CDN response.
