# Try It!

You can load your own Blob ID with the following URL pattern:

`https://cdn.suiftly.io/blob/{Your Blob ID}`

Example image: https://cdn.suiftly.io/blob/fK7v0bft1JqVbxQaM_KJAYkejbY9FgU9doqZwg7smw8

Notes:
   - The first time will be slow because your blob is being retrieved with Walrus and cached by Suiftly servers and globaly by the CDN.
   - For now, the blob size is limited to 200 MiB.
   - The CDN has 10 PoPs around the world and is DDoS protected.


Stay tuned, this is just the first feature!
